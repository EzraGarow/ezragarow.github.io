              <p>I am currently planning to continue researching the use of video games for historical presentation and education.</p>

              <p>This client provided the text for the project, and I then worked independently to arrange the parts and create or find visuals to accompany it.</p>

              <p>I georeferenced the maps for three out of four of the years in this project, a process which included researching town records and even using photographs to determine where addresses had been in relation to the present day. I also created a master storymap which contained scrollable versions of all four years worth of maps.</p>
